    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Thread.start() / join()</b>. Provide a Runnable object. The Runnable interface defines a single method,
            run, meant to contain the code executed in the thread. The Runnable object is passed to the Thread
            constructor, as in the HelloRunnable example:
            <pre><code class="java">public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable {

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello from a thread!");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        (new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start();
    }

}</code></pre>
            The join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. If t is a Thread object whose
            thread is currently executing,
            <pre><code class="java">t.join();</code></pre>
            causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates. Overloads of join allow the
            programmer to specify a waiting period. However, as with sleep, join is dependent on the OS for timing, so
            you should not assume that join will wait exactly as long as you specify.<br/>
            Like sleep, join responds to an interrupt by exiting with an InterruptedException.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Volatile</b>. The Java volatile keyword is intended to address variable visibility problems. By declaring
            the counter variable volatile all writes to the counter variable will be written back to main memory
            immediately. Also, all reads of the counter variable will be read directly from main memory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>CAS (Compare and Swap)</b>. <br/>
            CAS is generally much faster than locking, but it does depend on the degree of contention. Because CAS may
            force a retry if the value changes between reading and comparing, a thread can theoretically get stuck in a
            busy-wait if the variable in question is being hit hard by many other threads (or if it is expensive to
            compute a new value from the old value (or both)).<br/>
            The main issue with CAS is that it is much more difficult to program with correctly than locking. Mind you,
            locking is, in turn, much harder to use correctly than message-passing or STM, so don't take this as a
            ringing endorsement for the use of locks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Double checked locking</b>.<br/>
            <pre><code class="java">// Broken multithreaded version
// "Double-Checked Locking" idiom
class Foo {
    private Helper helper;
    public Helper getHelper() {
        if (helper == null) {
            synchronized (this) {
                if (helper == null) {
                    helper = new Helper();
                }
            }
        }
        return helper;
    }

    // other functions and members...

    <h2>Concurrent Collections</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>BlockingQueue</b><br/>
            BlockingQueue methods come in four forms, with different ways of handling operations that cannot be
            satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at some point in the future: one throws an exception, the second
            returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation), the third blocks the current
            thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time
            limit before giving up.<br/>
            A BlockingQueue does not accept null elements. Implementations throw NullPointerException on attempts to
            add, put or offer a null. A null is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of poll operations.<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>ArrayBlockingQueue</li>
                <li>LinkedBlockingQueue</li>
                <li>LinkedBlockingDeque</li>
                <li>SynchronousQueue</li>
                <li>LinkedTransferQueue</li>
                <li>DelayQueue</li>
                <li>PriorityBlockingQueue</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ConcurrentHashMap</b><br/>
            A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates. This class
            obeys the same functional specification as Hashtable, and includes versions of methods corresponding to each
            method of Hashtable. However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail
            locking, and there is not any support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. This
            class is fully interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on its thread safety but not on its
            synchronization details.<br/>
            <b>ConcurrentSkipListMap</b><br/>
            A scalable concurrent ConcurrentNavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural
            ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is
            used.<br/>
            This class implements a concurrent variant of SkipLists providing expected average log(n) time cost for the
            containsKey, get, put and remove operations and their variants. Insertion, removal, update, and access
            operations safely execute concurrently by multiple threads.<br/>
            <img src="data/maps.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet</b>.<br/>
            A thread-safe variant of ArrayList in which all mutative operations (add, set, and so on) are implemented by
            making a fresh copy of the underlying array.<br/>
            This is ordinarily too costly, but may be more efficient than alternatives when traversal operations vastly
            outnumber mutations, and is useful when you cannot or don't want to synchronize traversals, yet need to
            preclude interference among concurrent threads. The "snapshot" style iterator method uses a reference to the
            state of the array at the point that the iterator was created. This array never changes during the lifetime
            of the iterator, so interference is impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to throw
            ConcurrentModificationException. The iterator will not reflect additions, removals, or changes to the list
            since the iterator was created. Element-changing operations on iterators themselves (remove, set, and add)
            are not supported. These methods throw UnsupportedOperationException.
            All elements are permitted, including null.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Synchronizers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Lock</b><br/>
            <pre><code class="java">     Lock l = ...;
     l.lock();
     try {
         // access the resource protected by this lock
     } finally {
         l.unlock();
     }</code></pre>
            All Lock implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in
            monitor lock, as described in section 17.4 of The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification:
            <ul>
                <li>A successful lock operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful Lock
                    action.
                </li>
                <li>A successful unlock operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful Unlock
                    action.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Condition</b><br/>
            Condition factors out the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and notifyAll) into distinct objects to give
            the effect of having multiple wait-sets per object, by combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock
            implementations. Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and statements, a Condition replaces
            the use of the Object monitor methods.<br/>
            Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide a means for one thread to suspend
            execution (to "wait") until notified by another thread that some state condition may now be true. Because
            access to this shared state information occurs in different threads, it must be protected, so a lock of some
            form is associated with the condition. The key property that waiting for a condition provides is that it
            atomically releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread, just like Object.wait.<br/>
            A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a Condition instance for a particular Lock
            instance use its newCondition() method.<br/>
            <pre><code class="java">class BoundedBuffer {
   final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   final Condition notFull  = lock.newCondition();
   final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

   final Object[] items = new Object[100];
   int putptr, takeptr, count;

   public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException {
     lock.lock();
     try {
       while (count == items.length)
         notFull.await();
       items[putptr] = x;
       if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0;
       ++count;
       notEmpty.signal();
     } finally {
       lock.unlock();
     }
   }

   public Object take() throws InterruptedException {
     lock.lock();
     try {
       while (count == 0)
         notEmpty.await();
       Object x = items[takeptr];
       if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0;
       --count;
       notFull.signal();
       return x;
     } finally {
       lock.unlock();
     }
   }
 }
 </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ReentrantLock</b><br/>
            A reentrant mutual exclusion Lock with the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock
            accessed using synchronized methods and statements, but with extended capabilities. <br/>
            A ReentrantLock is owned by the thread last successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread
            invoking lock will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when the lock is not owned by another thread.
            The method will return immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can be checked using
            methods isHeldByCurrentThread(), and getHoldCount().
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ReentrantReadWriteLock</b><br/>
            An implementation of ReadWriteLock supporting similar semantics to ReentrantLock.<br/>
            This class has the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Acquisition order. This class does not impose a reader or writer preference ordering for lock
                    access. However, it does support an optional fairness policy.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-fair mode (default). When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry to
                            the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy constraints. A nonfair lock
                            that is continuously contended may indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer
                            threads, but will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fair mode. When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an approximately
                            arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock is released either the longest-waiting
                            single writer thread will be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader
                            threads waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be assigned the read
                            lock. A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly) will block if either
                            the write lock is held, or there is a waiting writer thread. The thread will not acquire the
                            read lock until after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and released
                            the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons its wait, leaving one or more reader
                            threads as the longest waiters in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers
                            will be assigned the read lock.
                            A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly) will block unless both
                            the read lock and write lock are free (which implies there are no waiting threads). (Note
                            that the non-blocking ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.tryLock() and
                            ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.tryLock() methods do not honor this fair setting and will
                            acquire the lock if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Reentrancy. This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or write locks in the style
                    of a ReentrantLock. Non-reentrant readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
                    thread have been released. Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not vice-versa.
                    Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful when write locks are held during calls or
                    callbacks to methods that perform reads under read locks. If a reader tries to acquire the write
                    lock it will never succeed.
                </li>
                <li>Lock downgrading. Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock, by
                    acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the write lock. However, upgrading
                    from a read lock to the write lock is not possible.
                </li>
                <li>Interruption of lock acquisition. The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
                    acquisition.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code class="java">class RWDictionary {
    private final Map&lt;String, Data&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;String, Data&gt;();
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
    private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();

    public Data get(String key) {
        r.lock();
        try { return m.get(key); }
        finally { r.unlock(); }
    }
    public String[] allKeys() {
        r.lock();
        try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
        finally { r.unlock(); }
    }
    public Data put(String key, Data value) {
        w.lock();
        try { return m.put(key, value); }
        finally { w.unlock(); }
    }
    public void clear() {
        w.lock();
        try { m.clear(); }
        finally { w.unlock(); }
    }
 }</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>StampedLock</b><br/>
            StampedLock is an alternative to using a ReadWriteLock (implemented by ReentrantReadWriteLock). The main
            differences between StampedLock and ReentrantReadWriteLock are that:
            <ul>
                <li>StampedLocks allow optimistic locking for read operations</li>
                <li>ReentrantLocks are reentrant (StampedLocks are not)</li>
            </ul>
            So if you have a scenario where you have contention (otherwise you may as well use synchronized or a simple
            Lock) and more readers than writers, using a StampedLock can significantly improve performance.
            <br/>
            A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write access. The state of a StampedLock
            consists of a version and mode. Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and controls access
            with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of these methods may instead return the special value zero to
            represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion methods require stamps as arguments, and
            fail if they do not match the state of the lock. The three modes are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Writing. Method writeLock() possibly blocks waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can
                    be used in method unlockWrite(long) to release the lock. Untimed and timed versions of tryWriteLock
                    are also provided. When the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained, and all
                    optimistic read validations will fail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reading. Method readLock() possibly blocks waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that
                    can be used in method unlockRead(long) to release the lock. Untimed and timed versions of
                    tryReadLock are also provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optimistic Reading. Method tryOptimisticRead() returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not
                    currently held in write mode. Method validate(long) returns true if the lock has not been acquired
                    in write mode since obtaining a given stamp. This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak
                    version of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time. The use of optimistic mode for
                    short read-only code segments often reduces contention and improves throughput. However, its use is
                    inherently fragile. Optimistic read sections should only read fields and hold them in local
                    variables for later use after validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
                    inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough with data representations to check
                    consistency and/or repeatedly invoke method validate(). For example, such steps are typically
                    required when first reading an object or array reference, and then accessing one of its fields,
                    elements or methods.

            <b>Executors</b>.
            An object that executes submitted Runnable tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task
            submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling,
            etc. An Executor is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than invoking
            new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start() for each of a set of tasks, you might use:
            <pre><code class="java"> Executor executor = anExecutor;
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());

            <b>ExecutorService</b>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>ThreadPoolExecutor</b>. Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide
                    improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task
                    invocation overhead, and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources, including
                    threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks. Each ThreadPoolExecutor also maintains some
                    basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks. <br/>
                    To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many adjustable parameters and
                    extensibility hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient Executors factory
                    methods Executors.newCachedThreadPool() (unbounded thread pool, with automatic thread reclamation),
                    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int) (fixed size thread pool) and Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
                    (single background thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage scenarios.
                    Otherwise, use the following guide when manually configuring and tuning this class:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Core and maximum pool sizes</li>
                        <li>On-demand construction</li>
                        <li>Creating new threads</li>
                        <li>Keep-alive times</li>
                        <li>Rejected tasks</li>

                        <li>Finalization</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ForkJoinPool</b>. An ExecutorService for running ForkJoinTasks. A ForkJoinPool provides the entry
                    point for submissions from non-ForkJoinTask clients, as well as management and monitoring
                    operations. <br/>
                    A ForkJoinPool differs from other kinds of ExecutorService mainly by virtue of employing
                    work-stealing: all threads in the pool attempt to find and execute tasks submitted to the pool
                    and/or created by other active tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
                    enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks (as do most ForkJoinTasks), as
                    well as when many small tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients. Especially when
                    setting asyncMode to true in constructors, ForkJoinPools may also be appropriate for use with
                    event-style tasks that are never joined. <br/>
                    As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three main task execution methods summarized
                    in the following table. These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already engaged in
                    fork/join computations in the current pool. The main forms of these methods accept instances of
                    ForkJoinTask, but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain Runnable- or Callable- based
                    activities as well. However, tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead use
                    the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using async event-style tasks that are not
                    usually joined, in which case there is little difference among choice of methods. <br/>
                    This implementation restricts the maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
                    pools with greater than the maximum number result in IllegalArgumentException.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</b>. A ThreadPoolExecutor that can additionally schedule commands to
                    run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. This class is preferable to Timer when multiple
                    worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility or capabilities of ThreadPoolExecutor
                    (which this class extends) are required.<br/>
                    Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but without any real-time guarantees about
                    when, after they are enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution
                    time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission.<br/>
                    When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution is suppressed. By default, such a
                    cancelled task is not automatically removed from the work queue until its delay elapses. While this
                    enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks.
                    To avoid this, set setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean) to true, which causes tasks to be immediately
                    removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. <br/>
                    Successive executions of a task scheduled via scheduleAtFixedRate or scheduleWithFixedDelay do not
                    overlap. While different executions may be performed by different threads, the effects of prior
                    executions happen-before those of subsequent ones.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The main difference between ForkJoinPool and ThreadPoolExecutor is that ForkJoinPool is designed to accept
            and execute ForkJoinTask, which is a lightweight version of FutureTask, while ThreadPoolExecutor is designed
            to provide a normal thread pool which executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled
            threads. <br/>
            Another key difference between ThreadPoolExecutor and ForkJoinPool class is that ForkJoinPool uses work
            stealing pattern, which means one thread can also execute a pending task from another thread. This improves
            efficient in case of ForkJoinTask as most of ForkJoinTask algorithm spawn new tasks. You can further read
            Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz to learn more about work stealing pattern and other parallel
            computing patterns.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Callable</b>. <br/>
            The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are
            potentially executed by another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a
            checked exception.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Future</b><br/>
            A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Methods are provided to check if the
            computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation. The
            result can only be retrieved using method get when the computation has completed, blocking if necessary
            until it is ready. Cancellation is performed by the cancel method. Additional methods are provided to
            determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a computation has completed, the computation
            cannot be cancelled. If you would like to use a Future for the sake of cancellability but not provide a
            usable result, you can declare types of the form Future<?> and return null as a result of the underlying
            task.
            <pre><code class="java"> interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 class App {
   ExecutorService executor = ...
   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
   void showSearch(final String target)
       throws InterruptedException {
     Future&lt;String&gt; future
       = executor.submit(new Callable&lt;String&gt;() {
         public String call() {
             return searcher.search(target);
         }});
     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
     try {
       displayText(future.get()); // use future
     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
   }
 }</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atomic</h2>
    <p>The java.util.concurrent.atomic package defines classes that support atomic operations on single variables. All
        classes have get and set methods that work like reads and writes on volatile variables. That is, a set has a
        happens-before relationship with any subsequent get on the same variable. The atomic compareAndSet method also
        has these memory consistency features, as do the simple atomic arithmetic methods that apply to integer atomic
        variables.</p>
    <pre><code class="java">// not thread safe
class Counter {
    private int c = 0;

    public void increment() {
        c++;
    }

    public void decrement() {
        c--;
    }

    public int value() {
        return c;
    }

}</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="java">// synchronized
class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int c = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        c++;
    }

    public synchronized void decrement() {
        c--;
    }

    public synchronized int value() {
        return c;
    }

}</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="java">// atomic
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger c = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        c.incrementAndGet();
    }

    public void decrement() {
        c.decrementAndGet();
    }

    public int value() {
        return c.get();
    }

}</code></pre>
    <h2>Accumulator</h2>
    <p>One or more variables that together maintain a running long value updated using a supplied function. When updates
        (method accumulate(long)) are contended across threads, the set of variables may grow dynamically to reduce
        contention. Method get() (or, equivalently, longValue()) returns the current value across the variables
        maintaining updates.</p>
    <p>This class is usually preferable to AtomicLong when multiple threads update a common value that is used for
        purposes such as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization control. Under low update
        contention, the two classes have similar characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of this
        class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space consumption.</p>
    <p>The order of accumulation within or across threads is not guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class
        is only applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does not matter. The supplied accumulator
        function should be side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates fail due to contention
        among threads. The function is applied with the current value as its first argument, and the given update as the
        second argument. For example, to maintain a running maximum value, you could supply Long::max along with
        Long.MIN_VALUE as the identity.</p>
    <p>Class LongAdder provides analogs of the functionality of this class for the common special case of maintaining
        counts and sums. The call new LongAdder() is equivalent to new LongAccumulator((x, y) -> x + y, 0L.</p>
    <p>This class extends Number, but does not define methods such as equals, hashCode and compareTo because instances
        are expected to be mutated, and so are not useful as collection keys.</p>
