    <p>Use green/yellow/red strategy for application performance optimization. When you stay at start most useful is use
        "green" techniques. You can easily improve you metrics without hard work. </p>
    <p><b>Metrics</b>. We will discuss about performance advanced approaches in "Performance measurement" part but lets
        start with simple understanding measurable values. First one is throughput (=operations per time). Throughput is
        connected with response time (=time per each operation from start to begging) but not directly. We can use
        batching for evaluate multiple samples per time but response time of each one will be different. Here we have
        "low latency" vs "high throughput" problem: we can use batches for reach "high throughput" (like kafka) or
        process each sample independently (like rabbitmq). So in each case we shall select target metric: operation per
        second, response time, evaluation time, etc.</p>
    <p>After that we have to verify metric correctness. Is this metrics reflects real production performance? And is
        this metric is reproducible? What difference between indecent starts without any code changes.</p>
    <p><b>Application load</b>. When we want to optimize perforce we shall use load like in production. The are two main
        approaches: simulate using load testing tools (like JMeter) or mirror trafic from production to test instance.
        The second one is more complicate but measures will be more correct.</p>
    <div>
        <h2><span class="tl-point tl-point-lg tl-point-green"></span> First step</h2>
        <p><b>Better algorithms.</b> You can cleanup your code with label "Technical dept". After that you can remember
            about algorithms complexity and (for example) replace your <code>O(n)</code> algorithm to <code>O(log
                n)</code>. You can remove excess customization from your code: do you really need to setup this after
            startup time?</p>
        <p><b>Use code analysers</b>. You can use <a
                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-inspections.html">Intellij idea</a> code analyser or
            use <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">spotbugs</a> for detect low quality piece of code. May be this is
            easy to find something like loop with string joins without StringBuilder.</p>
        <p><b>Look to Database.</b> When we use Hibernate not all queries look good. You can analyse this in both sides:
            in
            application (show sql queries & plans analysis) or in database (detect long running queries & go deep with
            plans
            analysis). You can try to use cache when it is possible (local or remote).</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <b>Performance model</b>. We can discuss about performance in terms of "Startup time" + "Running time". In
            first step application prepares to start: start Java VM, load classes, construct service objects (like
            beans), in second one - executing. You no need to optimize first step for long running applications. In
            runtime you have to minimize time for gc / io wait / kernel wait / thread locks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Remember about WarmUp</b>. JVM use JIT for compile hot methods to native code (and sometimes cleanup
            this). So you have to load application and wait before measure performance.

        <div><b>Benchmarks (micro / macro / meso).</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Micro benchmark</b> - we try to optimize small piece of code. For this needs we recommend to use
                    <a
                            href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Macro benchmark</b> - we try to optimize user scenario. For this needs we recommend to use <a
                        href="https://jmeter.apache.org/">JMeter</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Meso benchmark</b> - we try to optimize multiple large scenarios. For this needs we recommend to
                    use
                    distributed tracing utils like <a href="https://zipkin.io/">Zipkin</a>.

            <p><b>Profiling</b>.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sampling profiler</b>. Watch memory every N seconds and detect what is going on in this time.
                </li>
                <li><b>Instrumented profiler</b>. Inject instructions into byte code and detect all actions. This one
                    can decrease performance to x5 times or more.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Latency</b>. We can use data locality principle: share less data between layers. All the time when we
            fetch data from db we waste our time to external logic (parse / fetch / resolve concurrency problems) and
            network. Or in the global level we can use Data center located with your user (for US users in US, for EU in
            EU, for Asia in Asia, etc), not only CDN can use this policy, you place your servers in target region.

        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <b>Performance measurement pitfalls</b>. When we try to increase performance 5 times it is easy for detect
            improvements. But when we got 5-10% improvements (or less) we found benchmark sensitivity. In perfect world
            we limited only by clock accuracy. But in real world we got multiple side effects like GC or OS background
            jobs. So we have to use A/B tests methodology: compare multiple runs with changes and without.
        <pre><code>A_GROUP: [T1,..., Tn]
B_GROUP: [t1, ..., tn]</code></pre>
        We can use AB Test calculator [<a href="https://abtestguide.com/calc/">?</a>] for this needs: set visitors as
        samples count and conversions as evaluation time.

        <p><b>Compare your needs and target load</b>. Be careful when you try nosql solution. Scalability and
            flexibility is expensive. Most common problem is manage entities connections. All the time you should
            remember about denormalization technique.</p>
        <p>Main aspect of any storage system is:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Read pattern:</b> index at the file level, index at the record level, secondary index, reverse
                indexing,
                batch operation, random access.
            </li>
            <li><b>Write pattern:</b> single record write, batch write, mutation (?)</li>
            <li><b>Partitioning:</b> centralized, range, hash</li>
            <li><b>Mutation:</b> append only, file versus records, record size, mutation latency.</li>

        <p><b>Optimize your service layers</b>. In JPA you can use second level cache or prevent it using Spring Cache.
        </p>
        <p><b>Denormalization</b>. You can store your aggregate without every time evaluation. For example you can save
            total articles count instead use <code>COUNT(*)</code> all the time. Or you can prevent multiple joins using

        <h2><span class="tl-point tl-point-lg tl-point-red"></span> Garbage collection</h2>
        <p>JVM manage heap memory itself (compared by C++ where it is user managed). So main task objective of GC is
            find unused objects in memory and remove it with hole filling. There are four main GC algorithms:
            serial collector, throughput collector, concurrent collector and G1 collector. We have tradeoff between
            memory and cpu consumption in limitation of cpu core count. </p>
        <div><img src="data/gc-target.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>GC removes objects from heap if no links from runtime stack. Main hypnosis of GC is weak hypnosis of
            generations: most objects a short living and old objects rarely links to new one. So we can split memory
            to generations: young & old generations. And we can collect objects in young separately of old. Trip from
            young to old can be defined by some age.</p>
        <div><img src="data/gc-young-old-permanent.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>In the same time we can split young generation into some sub regions. Egen - new objects will be allocated
            here. And two survivor spaces: s0 & s1. When the are not enough space in egen we start small collection:
            copy all objects from eden to s0 and someone from s1 to old generation. So in s1 we can find objects who
            survived after at least once gc.</p>
        <b>GC Performance metrics</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Throughput</li>
            <li>Predictable (latency)</li>
            <li>Footprint (memory usage)</li>
        </ul>
        <div><img src="data/gc-tradeoff.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        <h4>Serial GC</h4>
        <div><img src="data/gc--serial.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>This collector is default for single-processor machines. We stop all application threads (GC pause) during
            full GC.</p>
        <h4>Throughput collector</h4>
        <div><img src="data/gc--throutput.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>This collector is default for mutli-CPU machines with 64-bit JVM. We use multiple threads to collect the
            young generation. The throughput collector stops all application threads during minor and full GC.</p>
        <h4>CMS collector</h4>
        <div><img src="data/gc--cms.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>This collector eliminate the long pauses in full GC cycles. We stop all application threads during a minor
            GC, it also performs with multiple threads. </p>
        <h4>G1 collector</h4>
        <div><img src="data/gc--g1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>This collector designed to process large heaps (4GB plus) with minimal pauses. It divides the heap into a
            regions. G1 clean up objects from th old generation by copying from one region into another.</p>
        <p><span class="badge badge-info">Tip</span> You can call full GC manually using <code>System.gc()</code> when
            you known that is right time to wait.</p>
        <h3>Tuning</h3>
        <p><b>Heap size</b>. We can control heap size using <code>-Xms{N}</code> (initial) and <code>-Xmx{N}</code>
            (max).</p>
        <p><b>Generation sizes</b>. We can control ratio of young to old generation by <code>-XX:NewRatio=N</code>,
            young generation size by <code>-XX:NewSize=N</code> (initial) and <code>-XX:MaxNewSize=N</code> (max).</p>
        <p><b>Metaspace</b>. JVM loads classes and saves their meta data into metaspace (Java 8, in Java 7 - permanent
            generation) in separate heap space.
            This information contains only JVM specific meta data (not classes). We can prevent expensive resize of
            metaspace using large initial metaspace size.

        <p>Java distribute programs in java byte code compared C++ that distribute in binary distribute for specific
            platform, compared to Python or PHP that distribute there sources as is. But Hotpot (Oracle JVM
            Distribution) can dynamically compile byte code to native code when there methods is frequently used. In
            same time JVM can use optimization in flight.</p>
        <p><b>Java Client/Server compiler</b>. We can use <code>java -client -XX:+TieredCompilation</code> for specify
            server evaluation. This option effects startup time so when you have GUI application or short-running
            application it is matter.</p>
        <p>Trick of compiling java byte code to native called as "<b>Code Cache</b>". So you can tune this option by
            <code>-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=</code>
            (max size of code cache). You can detect compilation process when you turn on
            <code>-XX:+PrintCompilation</code> flag. Another trick is "inlining" controlling by <code>-XX:-Inline</code>
            (enabled by default), <code>-XX:MaxInlineSize=</code>, <code>-XX: +PrintInlining</code>.

        <div><img src="data/jvm-memory-footpint.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
        <p>We can allocate native memory via JNI calls or by NIO byte buffers (<code>allocateDirect()</code>). Most
            common case is buffers for filesystem and socket operation where write to nio buffer and sending data to the
            channel requires no copying between JVM and C libraries for transform data. Also you can allocate memory
            outside GC management. It is useful for large (16GB+) allocations where GC is not your best friend. Software
            for big data evaluation like Spark or Ignite like this trick. </p>
